    "bodyText": "Building projects is one of the best ways to truly learn. Unlike theory, projects push you to solve real problems and face challenges you didn’t expect. Every bug becomes a lesson, and every feature you finish feels rewarding. Web development, especially, lets you see instant results of your effort. The best part is sharing your creation with others and watching it actually help someone. That’s when code feels alive."
